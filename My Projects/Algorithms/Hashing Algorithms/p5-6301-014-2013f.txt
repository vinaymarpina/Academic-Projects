Fall 2013
Project 5

Version 1.0.

Due: 2 AM, Monday, October 21 on elearning


Compare the performance of the following hashing algorithms:
(a) separate chaining with 2-choice hashing,
(b) open addressing with double hashing,
(c) cuckoo hashing,
(d) any other hashing algorithm of your choice.

In cuckoo hashing, experiment with 2-4 tables, and 1-2 elements per bucket.
Assume that keys are long integers.
Test your programs on tables of size up to 10 million and propose the
best algorithm for the problem.

Input: similar format as project 4.  Write driver programs to illustrate
the performance of your algorithms.  For the best algorithm that you
selected, output just the number of times that Find failed.

Sample input:

Insert 45267
Insert 54627
Find 45267
Find 54672
Remove 45267
Find 45267

Sample output:
2
