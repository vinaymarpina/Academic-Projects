Write a program that implements an arbitrary precision
arithmetic package according to the specifications below.

Your need to represent only nonnegative integers.  The numbers
will be represented in base B (B chosen by you) by a linked list
(read about representing polynomials with linked lists).
Note that, for convenience, the list can be ordered from
the least significant ``digit'' to the most significant ``digit''.

The program takes input from stdin.  Each line is an arithmetic expression
with numbers (in decimal), +, -, *, ^ (exponentiation), and parentheses. 
Operator precedence: ^, *, {+,-} (same as in programming languages).
Your program should read each line and calculate the value of the expression
and print it to stdout.  A line with "0" means the program should stop.

Sample input:
48-24
24-48
(2*3+4)*(4*3+2)
((2*3
2^100
0

Sample output:
24
Negative numbers are not supported.
140
